If you are currently receiving eBay invoices in a currency other than US dollars, you will continue to receive your invoices in your selected currency. Beginning March 17, you will only be able to change your non-US currency to US dollars. We are making this change to create a streamlined user experience for seller disbursements and charges when you join managed payments.  Most US sellers are already billed in US dollars. The change will affect a small percentage of sellers who currently use foreign currencies on their eBay invoices.  Thank you for selling on eBay, Your Selling Team \n",

      "Hi Seth,  I want to make finding a great remote opportunity easier by sending you jobs that could match your skills and experience.  Hope this one offers you the flexibility you need to thrive: Mobile Engineer.  If this isn’t the right opportunity for you, perhaps you know someone else that may be interested?  Either way, I hope I can still be a resource for you down the line. Wishing you all the best!  Thanks, Sally\n",
